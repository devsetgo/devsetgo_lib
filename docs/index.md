# DSG Lib
**NOTE: This is a beta version and not ready for use.**

A set of common functions wrapped into a package, so I don't have to write the same code over and over. Oh and it makes the code more reusable.... or something like that.

### Base Functions
dsg_lib

- file_functions
    - open and save CSV, JSON, and Text files
- folder_functions
    - Make, delete, list directories, and get last change
