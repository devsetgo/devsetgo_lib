# DevSetGo Library - Documentation Versioning Migration Summary

## 🎉 Successfully Implemented Mike Versioning!

Your DevSetGo Library documentation has been successfully migrated to use Mike for versioned documentation deployment. Here's what has been accomplished:

### 📊 Current Version Structure

Your documentation now has **1 version** available:

1. **2025.5.4.1** - Your published documentation (corrected from mixed structure) [latest, stable]

### 🔗 Access Your Documentation

**Production URL:** https://devsetgo.github.io/devsetgo_lib/
**Local Development URL:** http://localhost:8000/ (when serving locally)

The version selector dropdown is located in the header navigation, allowing users to switch between versions easily.

### 🛠️ Available Commands

#### Local Development
```bash
# Deploy current version locally (no push)
make create-docs-local

# Deploy as development version  
make create-docs-dev

# Serve documentation locally
make serve-docs

# List all deployed versions
make list-docs
```

#### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy current version with push to GitHub Pages
make create-docs
```

#### Direct Script Usage
```bash
# Deploy specific version
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py deploy --version 2025.08.10-001 --push

# Deploy with aliases
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py deploy --version 2025.08.10-001 --aliases latest stable --push

# Deploy development version
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py deploy --dev --version dev --push

# List versions
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py list

# Delete a version
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py delete --version 2025.07.01-001 --push
```

### ✅ Migration Results

**✅ Existing Documentation Preserved**
- Your version 2025.5.4.1 documentation is preserved and accessible
- Proper Mike versioning structure implemented
- Mixed legacy content cleaned up from gh-pages root

**✅ Version Selector Enabled**  
- Dropdown appears in navigation header
- Users can switch between versions easily
- Material theme integration working properly

**✅ Automated Deployment Ready**
- Scripts ready for GitHub Actions integration
- Version detection works automatically from pyproject.toml, makefile, or __init__.py
- Development branches can deploy to appropriate version slots

**✅ Backward Compatible**
- Your existing documentation workflow enhanced with versioning
- All current documentation content preserved
- New versioning commands are additions to existing functionality

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the system**: Visit https://devsetgo.github.io/devsetgo_lib/ to see your versioned documentation

2. **Deploy new versions**: 
   ```bash
   # When you update your version with bumpcalver
   bumpcalver --build
   make create-docs  # This will create a new version automatically
   ```

3. **Development workflow**:
   ```bash
   # For development documentation
   make create-docs-dev
   ```

### 🔄 Workflow for Future Releases

1. **Development**: Work on `dev` branch → use `make create-docs-dev` for development documentation
2. **Release**: Update version with bumpcalver → use `make create-docs` to deploy new versioned documentation  
3. **Version Management**: Documentation versions automatically match your project versions

### 📚 Documentation Structure  

Your documentation now includes:
- **Versioning Guide** (`docs/versioning.md`) - Complete versioning documentation
- **Quick Reference** (`docs/mike-quickref.md`) - Command reference
- **Version Selector** - Automatic dropdown in navigation
- **Migration Script** (`scripts/migrate_legacy_docs.py`) - For future reference

### 🔧 Technical Details

- **Mike Version**: 2.1.3 (already in your requirements.txt)
- **Version Strategy**: Calendar versioning matching your project  
- **Storage**: GitHub Pages with `gh-pages` branch
- **Aliases**: `latest` and `stable` for most recent, `dev` for development
- **Current Status**: Version 2025.5.4.1 deployed as [latest, stable]

### 🚨 Important Notes

- **No Overwrite Risk**: Your existing documentation is now safely preserved as version 2025.5.4.1
- **Clean Structure**: Mixed legacy content removed from gh-pages root  
- **Ready for New Versions**: When you update your project version, the documentation system will automatically create new versions
- **GitHub Pages**: The corrected structure has been pushed to your gh-pages branch

### 🎊 Your documentation versioning system is now fully operational!

The system preserves your published version (2025.5.4.1) and will automatically handle future versions as you update your project with bumpcalver. The next time you run `make create-docs`, it will detect your current version and create a new versioned deployment without overwriting existing versions.
